# Self Evaluation
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel fairly confident with the content on arrays so far. I think I need further practice and context or reading about methods to fully understand how they work.
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? 
I can tell that arrays and methods can be quite complex and we're just scratching the surface, but I'm content to leave my learning where it is right now. I think I'll be able to understand more about arrays and methods with some lessons or discussions in study hall about the concepts.
3. What questions do you have about arrays? 
Right now, I'm wondering how to relate elements in different arrays to one another, as in a database. I'm guessing that will come later!
